This is a multi-user Todo application built using Django, a popular Python web framework. It allows users to create accounts, manage their daily tasks, and keep track of their progress.

Features:



User Authentication: Users can sign up for new accounts and log in using a secure authentication system.

Task Management:Create new tasks.

View, update, and delete existing tasks.

Mark tasks as completed for clear organization.

Multi-User Functionality: Each user has their own set of tasks, ensuring personal productivity.

Getting Started



Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

pip (package installer) (comes bundled with Python 3.x)

A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

Installation:

Clone this repository: git clone https://your_repository_url.git

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (replace with your actual requirements file)

Database Setup:

Create a database (e.g., using MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Configure database settings in myproject/settings.py.

Run database migrations: python manage.py migrate

Run the Application:

Start the development server: python manage.py runserver

Access the app in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8000/)

User Authentication

The app uses Django's built-in user authentication system. Users can sign up and log in through dedicated views and forms. The User model is extended or a custom user model is created to store additional user data if needed.

Task Management

The app uses a Task model to store task details, potentially linked to the User model using a foreign key relationship. Views and templates are created to handle:



Adding new tasks with relevant details (e.g., title, description, due date)

Displaying a list of tasks for the logged-in user

Updating task details (e.g., edit title, mark as completed)

Deleting completed or unwanted tasks

Additional Considerations



Security: Secure password hashing and user authentication practices are essential.

Session Management: Use Django's session framework to maintain user sessions.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and validation for user input.

Deployment: Consider deployment options like Heroku or AWS for production use.
